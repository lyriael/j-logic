Justification Logic as part of the larger field modal logic provides some means to give more information about a proof. Information and researches about this topic are currently still rather limited. 

However the thesis presented here does not concern itself with the theoretical details of Justification Logics but focus on a proof search approach for this specific logic.  The implementation is done in the language Python.
