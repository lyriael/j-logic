Justification Logic as part of the larger field of modal logic provides some means to give more information about a proof. Information and researche about this topic are currently still limited. 

However the thesis presented here does not concern itself with the theoretical details of Justification Logic but focuses on a proof search approach for this specific logic. The implementation is done in the Python language.
