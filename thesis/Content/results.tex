Looking back from where I stand now there are many things I would probably have made differently. There is for example a python module called \emph{Pyparser}\todo{Link, Source or anything!}. It allows to create and execute simple grammars and it would have served me to get rid of some of the hard-coded string comparison. An other point I often reflected on it the choice of language. There might have more suitable programming languages for this task then python for example a functional language such as haskell. 

Those are things that I would probably do differently on the other hand there are a lot of things that I could be done to further improve this implementation that have not been possible in this limited time. For user to profit from this implementation it would be necessary g to create a (simple) user interface and even more important it would be necessary to extend this implementation in a way that it may handle any formulas and not just such that use implications. At the very least a negation should be added to archive completeness of the logic structure.

A last point that should be mention is the possible optimization of the implementation of this algorithm. As mention already in the introduction no special care has been given to consider the speed and the algorithm has not been tested for extremely large formulas which might cause the implementation to break due to stack overflow.
