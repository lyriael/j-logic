\section{Application}
Until very recently this step (merging and matchin) had a very different approach, which unfortunately proved to hold more than one mistake. Some could be fixed but one remained that could not be fixed with the original approach so after I though I would be done with coding I had to reimplement this whole part again. But in exchange it is no operating as it is supposed to.
